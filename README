pwsafe.py
=========
Python3 library to manipulate PasswordSafe V3 files
---------------------------------------------------

Installation
============

To install ``pwsafe.py`` use pip as usual. Note that ``pwsafe.py``
depends on the twofish_ library.

.. code:: shell

   pip install https://github.com/marcogiusti/pwsafe.py

.. _twofish: https://pypi.org/project/twofish/


Usage
=====

To write to a file, create a new PwsafeV3Writer with a file object and
the passphrase and start writing records with the ``write_record``
method. The V3 format file need an header and a series of records.

.. code:: python

   >>> import io
   >>> import pwsafe
   >>> fp = io.BytesIO()
   >>> db_password = b'secret'
   >>> writer = pwsafe.PwsafeV3Writer(fp, db_password)
   >>> header = [pwsafe.Version(3), pwsafe.UuidField.uuid4()]
   >>> writer.write_record(header)
   >>> uuid = pwsafe.UuidField.uuid4()
   >>> title = pwsafe.Title('Github account')
   >>> url = pwsafe.Url('https://github.com')
   >>> username = pwsafe.Username('marcogiusti')
   >>> password = pwsafe.Password('qwerty')
   >>> record = [uuid, title, username, password]
   >>> writer.write_record(record)
   >>> writer.close()

``PwsafeV3Writer`` does not explicitely close file object it receaved,
remember to do it yourself.

To read from a file, use the ``PwsafeV3Reader``. Let's reuse the file we
already created.

.. code:: python

   >>> fp.seek(0)
   0
   >>> reader = pwsafe.PwsafeV3Reader(fp, db_password)
   >>> header_read, *records = list(reader)
   >>> header_read == header
   True
   >>> records == [record]
   True
